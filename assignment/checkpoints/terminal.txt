# 1 - What is the command for listing the files in the current folder (directory)?
ls displays all the files in the currently accessed directory

# 2 - What is the command for changing directories?
cd changes to the specified directory

# 3 - What is the command for going "up" a folder (to a parent directory)?
cd .. moves up one folder to a parent directory.

# 4 - What is a quick way to create a new folder?
mkdir creates a directory or folder in the currently accessed folder

# 5 - What output would you expect when you run the command 'ls' in an empty folder? What about a folder containing files?
The ls command displays nothing in a directory with no files, the cursor moves to a new line but no additional text besides the current directory is displayed.
On the other hand, the ls command in a folder with files displays the files present in readable blocks.

# 6 - What is a quick way to create a new file?
The command touch followed by the file name creates a file in the currently accessed directory.

# 7 - Run 'git --version' in your terminal. What is the output?
git version 2.15.0

# 8 - Why would you run the command 'git status'?
git status is useful for seeing the status of the git folder. For instance, git status will return untracked files (files not a part of the version control of the created Git repository yet),
files that have uncommitted changes, files that have committed changes. The command effectively allows us to monitor the status of every file in that git repository.

# 9 - What does the command 'git add .' do?
git add . adds the current folder (denoted by the .) to the git repository. It is also what is known as staging a commit, the step that is required to tell git what files we are going to commit to the repository.

# 10 - What is the command to push your committed changes to your repo on GitHub?
The command git commit -m "message" will commit the files that were staged previously with the git add . command. The message is used to communicate what we are currently doing with the commit.
An example of that is "Adding new-file.txt".
